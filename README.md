# Angular AutoWrap

## Why?
[Here's](http://zpbappi.com/angular-autowrap-validation-and-control-template/) the complete history, if you are interested.

## Getting it
Check the [latest release](https://github.com/zpbappi/angular-autowrap/releases/latest) and download your favorite flavor of the library.

I am working on a automated build process to make it even easier to get.

## Building from source
Make sure that you have [gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md) installed globally. 
Then, on the project root folder, run the following commands in sequence:
```sh
npm install
gulp
```

## Using it
Yet TODO...

For now, check the `example` folder. Make sure you build the source library first.
