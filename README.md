# angular-autowrap
## Building
Make sure that you have [gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md) installed globally. Then, on the project root folder, run the following commands in sequence:
```sh
npm install
gulp
```

Now you will have minified version in `dist/release` folder 
and debug version with source maps in `dist/debug` folder.
