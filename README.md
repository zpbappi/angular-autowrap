# Angular AutoWrap
## Getting it
Check the `dist` folder for Angular AutoWrap javacript library for now. 
Will be adding other methods of getting it soon.

## Building from source
Make sure that you have [gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md) installed globally. 
Then, on the project root folder, run the following commands in sequence:
```sh
npm install
gulp
```

## Using it
Yet TODO...

For now, check the `example` folder.
