# Angular AutoWrap
## Building
Make sure that you have [gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md) installed globally. Then, on the project root folder, run the following commands in sequence:
```sh
npm install
gulp
```

Now you will have minified version 
and un-minified version with source map in `dist` folder.

## Usage
Yet TODO...

For now, check the `example` folder.
